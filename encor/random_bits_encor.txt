You need a route to Null0 in order to match packets that you summerized but don't actually have a route for

You have routes
1. 10.0.1.0/24
2. 10.0.2.0/24
3. 10.0.3.0/24
4. 10.0.4.0/24
5. 10.0.5.0/24

You summerize them into 10.0.0.0/16
What happens to a packet destined for 10.0.6.1?

Routing loop occurs
1. Router A and B are EIGRP neighbors and Router A has Router B configured for its default gateway
2. Router A summerizes 10.0.0.0/16 and gives that route to Router B
3. Router B gets a packet destined for 10.0.6.1
4. Router B's FIB matches with 10.0.0.0/16
5. Router B sends the packet to Router A
6. Router A checks the longest matching prefix: 0.0.0.0/0 to Router B
7. Router A sends the packet to Router B
8. Goes on forever

If you had a Null0 route:
6. Router A checks the longest matching prefix: 10.0.0.0/16 to Null0
7. Router A discards the packet
