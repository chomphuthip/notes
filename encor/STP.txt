====== STP ======
Created Saturday 28 October 2023

root port is port with lowest distance to the root bridge

for each link between two nonroot bridges there are two possibilities
1. Desg port to Root port
2. Desg port to Blk port

Either the link is downstream/upstream, or it is blocking

STP is spanning //tree// protocol, the L2 network should look like a tree
	Desg to Desg is like a branch recombining with another branch in a tree graph (not supposed to happen)

STP //forces// heirarchical networks with a single active link going upstream

Scenario 1:
A is the root bridge
STP doesn't make us choose between who is closer between B and C since they aren't connected

Scenario 2:
STP forces C to be lower in the hierarchy since STP forces hierachy
B is closer to A, so B gets to be forwarding and C is Blk on the link between B and C

TREES DON'T HAVE LOOPS
	THERE MIGHT BE A PHYSICAL LOOP, BUT WE CAN  LOGICALLY IGNORE TRAFFIC FROM THE SUPERIOR SWITCH

Port state: blocking, listening, learning, fowarding
Port role: root, desg, blk

If there are two links of equal cost going upstream, how does the switch know which one to blk and which one to rp
1. Check the port priority, the one with the lower port priority on the other end is chosen
2. If the port priority is equal, the link with the lower port number on the other end
