remove-as-path happens before route-map <route map name> out 

--------------------

Weight
	Affects which path the local router (router you are configuring) will nominate to be installed into it's global RIB
Local Preference
	Affects which path the autonomous system will elect and install into their RIB
Metric
	Affects which path the routers of an external autonomous system will install into their RIBs

== Weight Configuration ==

Configuring weight for one neighbor
	neighbor <neighbor IP> weight 100
Configuring using route map
	route-map weight_map permit 10
	 set weight 100
	neighbor <neighbor IP> route-map weight_map in

== Local Preference Configuration ==

Configuring local pref of all paths coming from this router
	bgp default local-preference 100
Configuring using route map
	route-map local_pref_map permit 10
	 set local-preference 200
	neighbor <neighbor IP> route-map local_pref_map out

== Metric Configuration ==

Configuring metric 
	route-map metric_map permit 10
	 set metric 9999
	neighbor <neighbor IP> route-map metric_map out
