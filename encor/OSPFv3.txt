====== OSPFv3 ======
Created Saturday 09 September 2023

Basically evey link between two routers is its own subnet in IPv6.

In OSPF, you would talk about the networks you were attached to, because the links that you are attached to also are the routers.
Now, you seperate the links from the networks beacuse thats not the case anymore.

Before a Type 1 LSA describes all this:
	Link ID 2.2.2.1 is the link between Router 5.5.5.1 connected to stub (link type, not area type) network 10.0.0.0/30 with a cost of 1
Now its a Type 1 LSA to describe the link:
	Link ID 2.2.2.1 the link between Router 5.5.5.1 connected to a stub  network  with a cost of 1
And then a corresponding type 0x2009 LSA to describe the network:jjj
	Link ID 2.2.2.1 is attached to 192.168.2.0/24

OSPF topology is network based (where do you want to go)
OSPFv3 topology is link based (who is connected to who)

Insanely good video on OSPF:

| Network Type | Definition                                                                       |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P2P          | A network with just another router at the other end.                             |
| Stub         | Network with no other routers attached like a switch connecting a bunch of hosts |
| Transit      | A network with packets that might not involve the router or its neighbor         |


OSPF gives every link an ID and what networks they are attached to in order to run SPF (Dykstra's).
OSPFv3 gives every link and ID, but does not attach the network in the same LSA

Type 8 is literally just to share what the link local address of the neighbor is
Type 9 is telling you about what networks correspond to which Links

TYPE 7 LEAVE
TYPE 5 CAN NOT COME IN
NOW THE NSSA AREA NOW KNOWS ABOUT THE EXTERNAL ROUTE SINCE EVERYONE IS SHARING THE TYPE 7

What are LSAs?
1. They are advertisements about links
2. They can be duplicated throughout an area or throughout a domain
3. They are kept in link state databases (LSDBs)

--------------------

Network statement selects all interfaces in global RIB, adds those interfaces to the LSDB, and starts sending and processing OSPF packets

--------------------

Route Filtering

filter-list filters Type 3 LSAs from getting into an area
	area X filter-list prefix <prefix list> in makes it so the prefixes denied in the prefix list don't make it IN to the area
	area X filter-list prefix <prefix list> out makes it so the prefiexes denied in the prefix list don't make it //OUT// of the area

distribute-list filters out prefixes from being installed in the global RIB, but not the OSPF LSDB
	for when you want to filter out routes on a specific router instead of the whole area

--------------------

IPv4 summarization

area 1 range 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0
255-252 = 3; 0 through 3, so if you have 192.168.0.0, 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, and 192.168.3.0, you can use it

Method to get correct summerization, get broadcast address of last prefix
	above it would be 192.168.3.255

now get the first different bit from the left
11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 (beginning of the ip range)
11000000.10101000.00000011.11111111 (end of the subnet range)
so its a /24 CIDR  or 255.255.252.000
