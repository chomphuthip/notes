====== BGP ======
Created Saturday 09 September 2023

As long as TCP segments can reach the other router, BGP pairing can occur.
Routers can be 254 hops away or right next to eachother, as long as they can send TCP traffic, they can peer as BGP neighbors
You need to configure ebgp-multihop

What happens when you configure a //network// statement:
1. BGP reformates the network statement into network reachability layer information (NRLI) which includes the network and prefix
2. BGP checks if the NRLI exists in the routers RIB. If it doesn't the //network// statement stays, but BGP doesn't look any further.
3. BGP adds the NRLI into the Loc-RIB. Loc-RIB (local RIB) is the BGP database.
4. BGP checks if the next hop is reachable. If not, the NRLI still stays in the Loc-RIB
5. BGP checks if the NRLI adheres to outbound route policies (don't really know what happens if it doesn't)
6. BGP adds it to the Adj-RIB-Out
7. If the NLRI's next-hop BGP prefix attribute is 0.0.0.0, then the next-hop is changed to the router's IP

What happens when an NRLI is recieved:
1. BGP adds the NRLI into the Adj-RIB-In table
2. BGP checks if the NRLI adheres to inbound route policies
3. BGP adds the route to the Loc-RIB.
4. BGP checks if the next hop is reachable
5. BGP checks if this path is better than the preexisting path if one exists already
6. BGP installs it into the router's global RIB
7. BGP checks if the NRLI adheres to outbound route policies
8. BGP installs the route in the Adj-RIB-Out table

Prefix Advertisements are notes being passed around autonomous systems.
	AS routers add their ASN to AS_Path and send it to all peers

Basically if everyone knows about everyone elses routes to where ever, in the event of an emergency,
	traffic might go where ever (nondeterministic)

You want traffic to flow deterministically so then troubleshooting is easier and your designs actually do something
	If you design an awesome WAN that saves a bunch of money by not buying more than whats necessary for a circuit
		but another circuit goes down and suddenly theres a bunch of traffic going through that first circuit, it could get ugly

The best way to ensure deterministic the routing of traffic is to control what routes are being used by routers.

Methods of controlling what routes are being used by BGP routers
| Method              <| Description                                                                |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IP ACLs              | Match based on IP                                                          |
| Prefix Lists         | Match based on IP but more flexible since we can use ranges                |
| AS_Path ACLs (regex) | Only cares about AS_Path                                                   |
| Route Maps           | Uses all the other ones to classify the NRLI and can do funky things to it |

prefix lists
	prefix has to match
	prefix length has to meet requirements

iBGP neighbor does not install BGP routes from its iBGP neighbor because the routes should be shared by an actual IGP like OSPF or EIGRP

--------------------

weight: make router prefer path
local pref: make all routers in AS prefer path
MED: make eBGP peers prefer path (let other autonomous system know which path you prefer

If you want to manipulate which way you leave the autonomous sytem
	use weight
If you want to manipulate which way the neighboring AS enters your system
	use MED
