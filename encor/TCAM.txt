====== TCAM ======
Created Tuesday 26 September 2023

CAM: Putting in a set of 1s and 0s will return a pointer
TCAM: Putting in a set of 1s, 0s, and mask to return a pointer

Because TCAM is so expensive, Cisco had to limit the amount of TCAM in each switch
But because TCAM is used for a lot of different functions, Cisco gave us away to ration TCAM based on what the device is going to do.
