Roams are coordinated between APs using UDP 16666
	if the mobility peer is inside the subnet, its a layer 2 roam because the UDP 16666 stays in the same subnet
	if the mobility peer is outside the subnet, its a layer 3 ream beacuse the UDP 16666 has to go to a different subnet

fast roaming is caching stuff

When a client L3 roams to another WLC, the new WLC (foreign/Point of association) encapsulates the IP traffic in a CAPWAP
	tunnel and sends that traffic to the original WLC (anchor/Point of presence) so the traffic

This is so the client doesn't have to change it's IP as its packets will be going out of the anchor WLC's interface instead of the new one

If you make your dynamic channel assignment too sensetive/too often, it can interrupt service to clients because the APs
	will constantly be changing radio channels

Mobility Groups are groups of WLCs that do mobility message exchanges that allow intercontroller roams to be coordinated
	Layer 2: client entry in database is transfered over to foreign AP database
	Layer 3: client entry in database is copied over to foreign AP database (entry still exists in anchor AP database)

but because clients ultimately choose when they want to roam, if a client roams to an AP with a WLC that is outside the 
	anchor APs mobility group, the client will simply leave the anchor AP database and join the foreign AP database
	with no coordination

--------------------

EAP-FAST is the only EAP tunneling method that doesn't use certificates, instead it uses Protected Access Credentials
	consisting of a shared secret, 'opaque element', and 'other information' (thanks Cisco)

Opaque element is remembered by the client. When doing mutual authentication, the server will extract the opaque element to
	authenticate the client.

Other information is a unique ID for the PAC, so then you can cache multiple and have a PAC keychain with different PACs for
	different servers.

802.11r
	client stores key to show to foreign APs attached to a single WLC that is using a RADIUS server.
		 once they see this key, they will instantly let the client associate with them
	club wristband for all APs using the same RADIUS server (intra or intercontroller)
Key caching
	client stores key to show AP. if ever roams back to that specifc AP, the client will be authenticated instantly
	club wristband for the same AP if you come back
CCKM
	WLC stores keys for each client  and when an intracontroller roam happens, the WLC sends the key to the AP to let them know
		that the client is cool.
	The WLC knows the client is cool because the client has Cisco Client Extensions installed on it. (main limitation of CCKM).
	club wristband for all APs attached to all WLCs inside a mobilty group
