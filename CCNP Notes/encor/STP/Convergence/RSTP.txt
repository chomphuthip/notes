====== RSTP ======
Created Saturday 28 October 2023

Instead of doing things by timers, RSTP allows switches to act autonomously

In STP, all BPDUs originate from the root bridge and are forwarded down.
	If a downstream switch didn't recieve a BPDU for 20 seconds, it would be safe to assume that the upstream switch is unavailable
		because its not doing its job.
	Then it would transition into its other states

In RSTP, all switches (not just root bridge) can send out BPDUs. This means that switches can ask if the upstream switch is alive themselves.
	They no longer have to wait for 20 seconds.
	They can just ask 'Hey, are you alive?' and then start transitioning another port into forwarding if need be.
