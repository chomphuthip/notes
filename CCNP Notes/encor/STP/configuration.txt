====== configuration ======
Created Sunday 29 October 2023

Modern cisco switches have 3 versions: pvst, rapid-pvst, mst

pvst is running old stp per vlan
rapid-pvst is running rstp per vlan
mst is mst

if you do 'show spanning-tree'
* Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee = pvst
* Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp = rapid-pvst
* Spanning tree enabled protocol mstp = mst

!configure switch as root bridge 
!it will actually go out and find the priority of the current root bridge and set itself higher than that one
spanning-tree vlan [whatever vlan] root primary

!set priority
spanning-tree vlan [whatever vlan] priority [number]

!modify spanning-tree cost
int g0/1
 spanning-tree cost 1

!if you want to specify cost for a specific vlan
int g0/1
 spanning-tree vlan 1 cost 1

!modify port prioirty (if there are two links to a downstream switch, which link should the downstream switch use)
int g0/1 
 spanning-tree priority 64
 spanning-tree vlan 99 priority 32
