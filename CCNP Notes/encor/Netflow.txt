====== Netflow ======
Created Monday 18 September 2023

netflow exports all flows
flexible netflow exports flows by key

netflow has
* capture
* export

Fnetflow has 
* flow recorder
* flow exporters
* flow monitors
* flow samplers

In netflow, all flows are unique by
1. source ip address
2. destination ip address
3. source port number
4. destination port number 
5. layer 3 protocol type
6. Type of service (QoS)
7. input logical interface

these are called key fields

flexible net flow allows you to pick and choose which key fields matter

In flexible netflow, you can pick and choose which key fields should make two flows unique from one another
	If you wanted to get the amount of bytes between two hosts in a single flow, you would configure the flow record like this:
	match ipv4 source address
	match ipv4 destination address
	capture bytes

monitor = exporter + record
exporter keeps track of where to export data to
record keeps track of what data to record
flow montior is a combination of the two that is the actual thingy that is applied to an interface

this architecture allows you to use the same record for different ports and exporters for different records
	you can mix and match, pick and choose what flow data gets exported to which flow server

(imagine unix)
sampler | monitor
sampler controls how many packets are going to the monitor
