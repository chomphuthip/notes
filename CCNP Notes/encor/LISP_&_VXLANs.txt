====== LISP & VXLANs ======
Created Sunday 24 September 2023


== LISP ==
Outer encapsulation is router to router
Inner packet is host to host

Regular IP has Network ID and Host ID in same address
this is ok but isnt as scalable 

ITR
	encapsulates packets from hosts
ETR
	deencapsulates packets from hosts
	because they are the ones attached to the hosts and directly sending data their way, they also publish eid-rloc mappings to MS
xTR
	does both
Proxy ITR
	encapulates packets from a L3 network for traffic going into a LISP domain
Proxy ETR
	deencapsulates packets from a LISP domain out to an L3 network
Proxy xTR
	does both
MS
	mapping server
	tells ITRs what the RLOCs for EIDs are if it isn't already in their routing table

--------------------

== VXLANs ==

VXLAN switches are called Virtual Ethernet Modules (VEMs)

 Ports that interract with VXLANs are called VTEPs
	Virtual Tunnel Endpoints

VEM puts Ethernet frame from host into VXLAN-GPO packet (UDP) and unicasts it from its VTEP to other VTEP 
	Ethernet frame is inside
	VNI (VXLAN Network Identifier, new VLAN ID) is in header.

Other VEM gets the VXLAN-GPO packet and deencapsulates it, and sends the frame out on the correct VLAN.

Host A: Host behind VEM A
VEM A: VEM attachted to host A
VTEP A: VTEP for VEM A


Host B: Host behind VEM B
VEM B: VEM attachted to host B
VTEP B: VTEP for VEM B


Discovery process
1. Host A sends an ARP request for Host B
2. VEM A learns about Host A on VXLAN 5000
3. VEM A encapsulates the ARP request, tags it with VNI 5000 and sends the encapsulated ARP request to multicast group 239.1.1.1
4. VEM B gets the ARP request and floods it on all ports configured with VXLAN 5000
5. Host B sends back an ARP response
6. VEM B sends back the ARP response to VEM A with VTEP B's address
7. Now VTEP A and VTEP B can unicast encapsulated Ethernet frames to each other

== MAKE VXLAN DECK ==
	also add priorities to weak pt2 profile
