====== BGP ======
Created Friday 22 September 2023

== Simple Configurations ==

!neighborship
router bgp <autonomous system number>
 bgp router-id router-id
 neighbor <ip address> remote-as <AS num,ber>

!sharing routes (routes wil
network <ip address> mask <subnet mask>

!redistritbute from ospf into bgp
 redistribute ospf <process id>


match community <community list name  or number>
!match commuity in route map
match community <community list name  or number>
!aggregate addresses
 aggregate-address <shorter prefix> <shorter prefix mask>

!summerize addresses (ips that are being advertised with //network// statement will still be shared)
 aggregate-address <shorter prefix> <shorter prefix mask> summary-only

!keep BGP path info when aggregating
  aggregate-address <shorter prefix> <shorter prefix mask> as-set summary-only

== Simple verifications ==

!show database
show bgp <address family (ipv4 or ipv6)> <subsequent address family (unicast|multicast)>

!show summary of bgp state
show bgp summary

!show neighbors
show bgp neighbors <ip address>

--------------------

== Advanced configurations ==

!configure a prefix list
ip prefix-list <prefix-list name> seq <sequence number> <prefix network> <prefix mask> <ge|le> <bits>
ipv6 prefix-list ...

!configure route map entry
route-map <route map name> <permit|deny> <sequence number>

!configure ACL matching statement in routemap
match ip address <acl number or name>

!configure prefix list matching statement in routemap
match ip address prefix-list <prefix list name>

!configure preference in routemap
match local-preference <preference>

!match commuity in route map
match community <community list name  or number>

!set community number in routemap
 set community <community number> <//additive// if you dont want to clobber the community numbers>

!set weight
 set weight <weight number>

!set local preference
 set local-preference <set metric number>

!set metric
 set metric <metric number>

!create regex acl
ip as-path access-list <acl number> <permit|deny> <regex query>

!create community list
ip community-list <name or number> <permit|deny> <community number or wellknown name>

!filter routes to neighbor using regular ACL
router bgp <as>
 neighbor <ip address> distribute-list <acl number> <in|out>

!filter routes to neighbor using prefix list
neighbor <ip address> prefix-list <prefix list name> <in|out>

!filter routes to neighbor using regex ACL
neighbor <ip address> filter-list <regex ACL number> <in|out>

!filter/change routes using routemap
neighbor <ip address> route-map <routemap name> <in|out>

!use new format to show bgp-community (X:X vs XXXXXX)
ip bgp-community new-format

== Advanced verification commands ==
!show community
show bgp community

!test regex
show bgp regexp <regex pattern>

!restart bgp
clear bgp soft
