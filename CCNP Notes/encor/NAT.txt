====== NAT ======
Created Wednesday 13 September 2023

inside - devices behind router doing the NAT
outside - devices outside of the router doing the NAT

local - internal IP
global - public IP

inside local - IP of device before translation
inside global - public IP of device after translation

outside local - IP of device outside after translation
outside global - IP of device outside before translation

you can have outside local if you wanted to hide/translate public IPs or something

PAT
	ip nat inside source list  <ACL_OF_DEVICES_YOU_WANT_TO_NAT> interface <outside interface> overload
	You specify the interface because NAT will select the IP configured on that interface as the IP for all packets being translated
Pooled NAT
	ip nat inside source list  <ACL_OF_DEVICES_YOU_WANT_TO_NAT> pool <pool name>
Static NAT
	ip nat inside source static <local IP> <global IP>

after translation is opposite
