--------------------

how to make a control plane policy that wont break everything at once
1. create your ACLs
2. create you classes
3. write your policy map with estimates for what you think each class should use minus 20%
4. make your policy map transmit all (exceed-action transmit, violate-action transmit)
5. run //policy-map control-plane input//
6. check the statistics to see if you were right

log keyword (used at the end of acl statement) doesnt work with copp
 so dont put acls with log keyword into classmaps
