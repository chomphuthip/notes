====== OSPF vs EIGRP ======
Created Friday 03 November 2023

OSPF shares LSAs
Types of LSAs:
1. All networks a router is attached to
2. Broadcast segment with multiple OSPF routers
3. One route from outside the area
4. A route to the ASBR
5. A route from outside the OSPF domain

All the routers will use these bits of information to calculate the best interface to send out packets in order to reach a network
	and then elect that route to be added to the routing table

EIGRP
1. It costs 10 for Router A to reach Network X
2. Router A tells Router B 
	a. Network X is downstream from me with a cost of 10
3. It costs Router B 20 to get the Router A
4. Router B tells router C
	a. Network XS is downstream from me with a cost of 30
5. DO this forever

EIGRP has faster convergence because EIGRP's protocol has less overhead

feasibility condition - i can use you as a next hop only if the distance between you and the network is less than the distance between
	me and the network
