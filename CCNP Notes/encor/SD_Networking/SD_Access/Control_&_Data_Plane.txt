====== Control & Data Plane ======
Created Tuesday 07 November 2023

LISP tells the router where to send the traffic to (control plane)
VXLAN encapsulates the frames and sends it there (data plane)

Because of this, the recommended MTU size is 9100

LISP IS ONLY USED TO SELECT THE END DESTINATION AND RETURN THE RLOC (which should tbe the VTEP)
	THEN THE LOCAL VTEP UNICASTS VXLAN UDP DATAGRAMS TO THE REMOTE VTEP
