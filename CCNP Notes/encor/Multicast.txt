====== Multicast ======
Created Monday 11 September 2023

We know kind of what multicast is:
	1. You tell your NIC: "I'm going to listen to this IP address now!"
	2. The thingy thats going to be doing the multicasting says: "I'm addressing this packet for this special address"
	3. BAM.
	4. You are getting multicast packets and other people are also getting multicast packets its awesome and great

== WRONG AREA (STUPID ALERT) ==
— 
Apparently its like this:
	IGMP is Layer 2 multicast
	PIM is Layer 3 multicast

Clients send an IGMP request to gateways to join a multicast group
Routers use PIM to send multicast traffic to eachother
—
== END OF WRONG AREA ==

By default, when a switch gets a multicast frame it will send it out on all interfaces because nobody actually uses the multicast frame for sending
But with IGMP snooping enabled, it can keep track of who is actually joining and leaving IGMP groups in order to minimize flooding

Routers who route multicast traffic have a table of group entries that look like (S,G) or (Source, Group)
	(Unicast address of device sending out traffic, Multicast address of group)

== Dense mode ==
1. host send router A IGMP join
2. router A floods (in PIM dense mode) L3 network with (*,G) requests
	1. (*,G) means all source, for this specifc group; (*, 239.0.0.1)
3. routers attached to router A floods their interfaces
4. eventually it reaches router Z
5. router Z forwards the (*,G) request to a source
6. source says STOP
7. router Z floods the L3 network with STOP requests
8. router Z does an RPF check
9. router Z floods its interfaces with a (multicast_source_unicast_ip, 239.0.0.1) response
10. router X and Y are both attachted to router Z, but the first (*,239.0.0.1) flood came from router Y
11. router X says 'hey, theres no multicast requests for group 239.0.0.1 behind me, leave me alone' (prune request)
12. router Z now knows in order to send traffic to 239.0.0.1, its going to send it to router Y

== Sparse mode ==
1. source sends a (my_unicast_address, 239.0.0.1) registration to the rendevous point
2. host sends router A an IGMP join for 239.0.0.1
3. router A, instead of flooding with (*,239.0.0.1) requests, sends the (*,G) request to the rendevous point's unicast address
4. rendevous point sends response saying (source_unicast_address, 239.0.0.1) back to router A
5. router A passes (source_unicast_address, 239.0.0.1) back to the host
6. the host sends a unicast request to the source saying 'hey i want multicast'
7. server sends first packet to rendevous point
8. rendevous point sends one packet to router A
9. router A sends it to host
10. now source sends traffic directly to router A
11. router A sends traffic  to host A

In the direction of the source
* reverse forwading path interface
* upstream interface
* incoming interface

In the direction of recievers
* outgoing interface
* downstream interface

--------------------

Multicast is about sending messages to multiple hosts with only one IP

Hosts use multicast addresses to know when something is addressed for them
Routers use multicast address to figure out where to send packets
Sources send packets addressed for multicast groups

====== THE SOURCE FOR MULTICAST TRAFFIC WILL USUALLY BE A UNICAST ADDRESS ======
The source is just a singular source sending out traffic.
====== WHEN YOU SEND OUT A PACKET TO A MULTICAST GROUP, YOU PUT YOUR UNICAST IP AS THE SOURCE IP. ======

LHR sends (*,G) to RP
When the source for group G sends out traffic destined for group G, the RP will send the first packet to the LHR
Since the packet source address is the source's unicast address, it sends a (S, G) to the FHR with S being the sources unicast address
The FHR can now send the traffic directly to the LHR
Since the LHR is already getting traffic direcly from the LHR, it sends a prune message to the RP.

OK BUT HOW DO INTERMEDIATE ROUTERS KNOW WHERE TO SEND MULTICAST TRAFFIC?
	During shared tree to source tree switch over, the FHR will send (S,G) joins to ever  hop until reaching the router
	During PIM dense mode, since the LHR is flooding, everyone is joining the (*,G) with an out going interface
		back to the LHR
		
--------------------
Auto-RP
you have the mapping agents
all the candidate RPs ask the mapping agents 'can i be the rp for the group'
mapping agents say 'hey i found an RP, here it is'
everyone listens to the mapping agents
if there are multiple RPs competing for a group, the mapping agent picks the highest IP and says 'hey i found this IP'
	the RP that lost feels no pain. It just forwards the announcement down

Bootstrap Rendesvous Point
Same thing, but instead
1. The bootstrap router tells all the routers about the possible RPs that they can pick
2. The candidate RPs unicast towards the boostrap rendesvous point

Also, every router on the network participating in BSR rendesvous election is running the same algorithm to determine which
	RP they are going to use.


Announce = Letting the mapping agent know that they want to be an RP 
Discover = mapping agent letting everyone know about the RP
