====== mpls & vpns ======
Created Thursday 05 October 2023

1. ce shares ospf routes with pe customer vrf ospf
2. multiprotocol bgp (mpbgp) redistributes routes from customer vrf ospf into vpnv4(or v6) protocol family
3. mp-bgp is igp peering with another pe router
4. other pe router redistributes routes from vpnv4 address family into customer vrf

mpls label encapsulates ip packet while itself being encapsulated by frame
	so basically a layer 3 protocol that encapsulates IP

mpls routers are unique to the router
	my label for this prefix is X
	the next hop's label for this prefix is Y

	my word for this is X
	your word for this is Y


vpn labels are unique to the pe peers
''confi''
Going through the MPLS network
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

After POP/last hop before PE IGP VPNv4 neighbor
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

then the PE router uses the L3VPN label to decide which vrf it should go into

The routers use MPLS when talking to eachother in an MPLS network

All your routers in the MPLS network must also be running BGP
	because iBGP requires either full mesh, route reflectors, or confederation

Schizopostiung
	vpn packet next hop was 10.0.23.2
	mpls tries to find a label for 10.0.23.2
	it can't find label for 10.0.23.2
	it drops it

	why can't it just use the 10.0.23.0/30 label??
	idk
 ITS BECAUSE THE NEXT HOP LABEL NEEDS TO BE FOR A ROUTER, NOT A NETWORK

THE NEXT HOP FOR VPN LABELS HAVE TO BE A LOOPBACK OR ELSE THERE ISNT GOING TO BE AN MPLS LABEL FOR 
	THAT ROUTER SPECIFICALLY

YOU NEED AN MPLS LABEL SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ROUTER BECAUSE IF NOT ITS GOING TO GET DROPPED AFTER
	THE MPLS GETS POPPED AND ITS ONLY THE VPNv4 LABEL
