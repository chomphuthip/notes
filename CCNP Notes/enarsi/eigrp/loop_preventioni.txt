if split horizon stops routes from being advertised on the interface 
	it recieved the route on, why do you need to turn it off to share
	routes between two spokes

its because the dmvpn hub has only one interface, so
	it'll learn 10.0.0.0/24 from tunnel0
	then it can't advertise it out of tunnel0 back to other dmvpn spokes
		if split horizon is off, since it learned it from that int

in a normal broadcast network, if a router wants to share a prefix, they will broadcast it
 so everyone will get the route
but in dmvpn broadcasting doesnt work normally
