Created Thursday 05 October 2023

make sure to use loopbacks as update addressses for MPLS
for normal between ASs, use link addresses

!configure local router to be route reflector
neighbor [neighbor IP] route-reflector-client


!router bgp (FAKE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM)
router bgp 65000
 !put peers only if you are eBGP peering with another internal AS
 bgp confederation peers 65001
 !identifier means what the "real" or outward facing AS should be
 bgp confederation indentifier 100

peer group - exactly the same configs for multiple because actually bgp is going to put out the exact same routing updates
	for all of them,
	literally does the processing for one of them, then sends the update to all of them
	simplifies configuration for engineer, and simplifies caluclations for CPU

peer template - adds templating to configuring  bgp neighbors and has two types:
	Session Template – Controls neighbor settings, such as TTL security, timers, and so on, it affects the actual BGP session with a neighboring 
	Policy Template – Controls address family settings, it affects protocol-specific (NLRI) policy (e.g. IPv4 versus IPv6).

When deterministic-med is enabled:
1. All considerations are compared until MED
2. All routes with the same AS_PATH are grouped together
3. The lowest MED in each group is taken

Example:
Route A goes through AS 100 and AS 200 and has a MED of 100
Route B goes through AS 100 and AS 200 and has a MED of 200
Route C goes through AS 50 and AS 200 and has a MED of 100

If the learned order of routes is B, C, A, then
1. Route A is compared to Route C, all considerations are the same, so oldest wins (Route C)
2. Route C is compared to Route B, all considerations are the same, so oldest wins (Route B)

The MED was never considered due to the learn time

Also, shouldn't we take into consideration the MED if the path is still going into the same AS (AS 200)
