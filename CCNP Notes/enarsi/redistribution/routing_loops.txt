====== routing loops ======
Created Thursday 26 October 2023

Redistribution can cause routing loops by routers learning a route from a routing protocol with a lower AD or lower metric.

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
1. Router 5 shares a directly connected network  A with Router 1 using OSPF (Type 1 LSA)
2. Router 1 shares the Type 1 LSA with Router 4
3. Router 4 redistributes the route into EIGRP
4. Router 4 shares prefix with Router 3
5. Router 3 shares prefix with Router 2
6. Router 2 shares prefix with Router 1
7. Router 1 replaces route to network A in the routing table (learned from OSPF) with the route learned by EIGRP
