== OUTLINE ==
1. Enable IGP (OSPF/EIGRP) in MPLS network
2. Enable MPLS in network
3. Create VRFs with matching route targets on PEs
4. Create iBGP adjacency on PEs
5. Activate VPNv4 on both PEs

== VRF ==
!used to tell routes appart locally
rd 1:1

!will exports routes under vrf as rd 3:3
route-target export 3:3

!will import routes with rds of 3:3 and 6:6
route-target import 3:3
route-target import 6:6

== MPLS ==
!use to confine labels to a certian range, allowing for easier debugging
mpls label range X000 X999

== BGP ==
!instead of neighbor X remote-as Y, you activate them. You are already nieghbors, now you activate them for this address family
neighbor 3.3.3.3 activate
