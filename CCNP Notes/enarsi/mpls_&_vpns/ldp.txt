Everyone in the label switched path (LSP) has an individual label for 10.0.0.0/24
	BUT HOW?

1. R1 shares a label 3 (implicit null) with R2, saying this is the label for 10.0.0.0/24
	a. Label 3 is a special label that says "if you need to send a packet to me for 10.0.0.0/24, pop the MPLS label and just forward me the packet)
	b. thats what implicit null means; you are at the last hop, so just take the mpls label off and give me what is left
	c. whats left could be a plain ip packet, but it could also be an IP packet WITH a VPN Label before, telling the PE the correct vrf to put it in
2. R2 decides that its LOCAL label for 10.0.0.0/24 will be 2001 and shares that label with R3
	a. Now when R3 wants to send a packet to R2 for 10.0.0.0/24, it will use label 2001
	b. Its like if you want to tell someone about something, you would use their word for it
3. R3 decides that its local label for 10.0.0.0/24 will be 3001 and shares that label with R4
	a. R4 now knows that R3 understands the prefix 10.0.0.0/24 as the label 3001
4. So on and so on through out the ENTIRE MPLS INFRASTRUCTURE
	a. Even if there are no neighbors that are 'behind' it in the LSP, a router will still generate a router for it

Notice that because all the routers are describe the same route, you can think of the label less of describing the prefix, but more a local name for the LSP itself, since a unique LSP is built for each prefix advertised

it creates a unidirectional graph going back to the source of the shared label
