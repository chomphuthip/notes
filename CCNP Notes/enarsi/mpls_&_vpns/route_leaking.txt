====== route leaking ======
Created Saturday 28 October 2023

this is the real reason why RDs and Route Targets are logically decoupled

You can only have one RD, but you have multiple route targets
1. One route target that you import and export as an individual customer across multiple customer sites
2. One route target that you only export as part of a group of customers that need Layer 3 access to a resource
3. And so on...

You can create a Route Target value that incorporates a bunch of CEs and not have them share routing information with each other

Creating a service that multiple customers can use, but it will not allow the customers to direclty talk with eachtother
1. Create a Route Target for customers that want to access the resource
2. Create a Route Target for the resource
3. On all the customers, 
	a. configure the vrf to import routes with the route target of the resource
		1. MAKE SURE TO NOT IMPORT THE ROUTE TARGET THAT SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO CUSTOMERS
		2. IF YOU DO, THE CEs WILL LEARN ABOUT ROUTES THAT DIRECTLY GO TO OTHER CUSTOMERS
	b. configure the vrf to export routes with the consumer route target added
4. On the resource VRF
	a. configure to export with resource route target
		1. consumers will import routes with this route target
	b. configure to import routes with consumer route target
		1. now the resource will learn about how to get back to all the customers

Route leaking can be performed locally on the router
