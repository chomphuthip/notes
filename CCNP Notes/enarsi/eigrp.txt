Created Saturday 14 October 2023

hello
	 hello keepalive, as well as sharing K values (K values must match before becoming neighbors
update
	if first time sharing routes: send all routes, unicast
	if update: just send updated route, multicast
query
	sent out to find a new path for a prefix during convergence
reply
	response to query
ack
	acknowledge the reply
request
	NEVER USED EVER EVER. IN EIGRP BECAUSE RIP HAD IT, BUT QUERY DOES ITS JOB ALREADY

in eigrp, the whole router is in the autonomous system
in ospf, interfaces can be in different areas



variance multiplier: how much you are willing to multiply in order to add the worse routes
	if you want to add a route that is 2 times worse that your best route, your variance is 2
		all routes that are between 1 and 2 times worse will also be added

3 times worse route and you still want to add?
	set your variance multiplier to 3

how much worse are you willing to accept?
	  5 times = 5 variance


--------------------

If you have two subnets that are inside a classful prefix and you have auto summary on, it can lead to a route with the wrong prefix
