Hub configuration
1. Configure IPsec Profile
2. Configure tunnel interface

!maps vpn ip to gloabl ip
ip nhrp map 192.168.0.1 201.69.57.2

!maps all multicasting to real ip of hub; if you want to multicast, send to this address
ip nhrp map multicast 201.69.57.2

!configure the hub/router resolving IPs and sending traffic when needed
ip nhrp nhs 192.168.0.1

if you dont configure point to mulitpoint on tunnel, ospf defaults to p2p connection
	works if only have 1 spoke and 1 hub, but if you add more they will fight over which one is the other end
	configure point to multipoint and your problems will all go away

!tells a sending spoke the real ip of the recieving spoke so a spoke to spoke tunnel can be formed and used
ip nhrp redirect

!configures the spoke to use the redirect information given from the dmvpn hub
ip nhrp shortcut
