NRLI - network layer reachability information
	basically a route

NRLIs have a 
	prefix
	next-hop
	AS_Path
	Other attributes (weight, local pref, MED)

When you receive an NRLI, you must have reachability to the next hop
	In eBGP, the next hop will be the advertising peer (not sure if the peer modifies the NRLI to make itself be the next hop, or if the recieving router changes it)
	In iBGP, the next hop is maintained from the originating router

The NRLI is then installed into the RIB (if it provides the best path to get to the prefix)
	NRLIs installed into the RIB are installed as recursive routes pointing to the next hop
	So if the next hop is unreachable, the route is not installed in the RIB

In iBGP the next hop is maintained because iBGP networks are expected to consist of directly connect iBGP peers.
	But when this is not the case, we can use next-hop-self to simulate how eBGP does it.
	With next-hop-self, any routers directly connected can use the sending router's IP as a next hop
