attack surface vs attack vector
    vector is specific
    surface refers to all the stuff that can be used

access control types

    discretionary access control (dac)
        access is decided by the object owner
        simpler
        no centralized
        if i own something, i can give access
        
    mandatory access control
        access is determined by labels and enforced by the engine
        strictest
        complex
        if i own something, i can only give access in accordance with da rules

    rule-based access control
        access is deteremined by rules applied to the subjecct
        scalable
        role creep

    attribute-based access control
        access is based on the attributes of the subjecct
        complex

cvss
    attack vector
    attack complexity
    privileges required
    user interaction
    scope
    temporal metrics
    environmental metrics

data visibility challenge
    encryption
    nat
    timestamps
    dns tunneling
    overal control
    blind spots
    limited resource monitoring

what is session data
    session data is a flow (5 tuple)

deep packet inspection vs stateful filtering
    deep packet inspection is 5=<
    stateful just keeps track of each flow to make sure its a valid dest
        since stateful only needs to track flows, its layer 4 only
    
elements of an incident response plan
    incident response plan mission
    strategies and goals of the incident response plan
    senior management approval
    organizational approach
    communications plan with incident response team
    metrics
    roadmap

applying the incident response plan
    preperation
    detection and analysis
    containment, eradication, and recovery
    post incident

cyber kill chain
    recon
    weaponization
    delivery
    exploitation
    installation
    c2
    action on objectives

time to
    detect
    contain
    respond
    control

inline means capturing and doing stuff inline
tap means copying packets and analyzing it somewhere else
if you have modes
    tap will analyze
    inline will analyze AND drop

policy
    signed record of commitment by leaders
    clear definition of why
    scope
    definitions
    organizational structure and responsibilities
    prioritization/severity ratings
    performance measurements
    reporting/contact forms

plan
    mission

fisma
    requires federal agencies to report to the united states incident emergency
    readiness team (blue incident response)

incident response team structure
    central
    distributed
    coordinating

incident response team staffing
    employees
    partially outsourced
    fully outsourced

team model selection considerations
    24/7 availability
    full time vs part time
    morale
    cost
    expertise

team outsourcing considerations
    quality of work (now and later)
    who is doing what
    contractor leaking stuff
    contractor not knowing about specific stuff (scada) (pepw)
    harder to put evidence together
    contractor might be dealing with other stuff
    you should at least have some humans

helping orgs
    management
    information assurance
    it support
    legal

    detection
    recovery
    post attack
